Disco - Massive data, Minimal code
==================================

Disco is an implementation of the `Map-Reduce framework
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce>`_ for distributed computing. Like
the original framework, which was publicized by Google, Disco supports
parallel computations over large data sets on an unreliable cluster of
computers. This makes it a perfect tool for analyzing and processing large
datasets without having to bother about difficult technical questions
related to distributed computing, such as communication protocols, load
balancing, locking, job scheduling or fault tolerance, all of which are taken
care by Disco.

See `discoproject.org <http://discoproject.org>`_ for more information.
