Release notes
=============

Disco 0.5.1 (TBD)
---------------
New features
''''''''''''
- Disco now uses folsom for monitoring purposes.  Folsom extracts some
  information from Disco and sends it to a graphite server. The folsom
  (and related) applications will start only if DISCO_PROFILE is set. This is
  not set by default.
  By default, folsom assumes that the localhost is the graphite server.  This
  can be overriden by using the GRAPHITE_HOST option.

- A docker file has been added that lets you install Disco in a Docker
  container.

- Disco now supports reading the job inputs and writing the job outputs to HDFS.
  This feature is still experimental.

- A spec file has been added to make it easy to create an rpm from the a Disco
  tarball.

Changes
'''''''

- The changes in the mochiweb fork of the Disco project has been merged into
  upstream and Disco is now using the upstream.

- New options are now passed to the erlang process on the master node that will
  disable scheduler compaction and spreads the schedulers as much as possible.

- Two options have been added to the ``ddfs chunk`` command to override the chunk
  size and the maximum record size.

- The save_info field has been added to the :ref:`jobpack <jobpack>`. For now, this
  field only contains the information needed for saving the outputs of the job
  into HDFS.

- A couple of examples have been added.  Namely, the naive-bayes and an example
  for reading huge xml files.  Moreover, the kclustering example has been
  re-implemented using the Disco pipelines.

Disco 0.5 (February 14, 2014)
---------------
This release is dedicated to the memory of Priya Hattiangdi, Prashanth Mundkur's wife, who has passed away a few days ago. May she rest in peace.

New features
''''''''''''
- A new :ref:`pipeline <pipeline>` model for Disco job computation.
  This model is a conservative extension of the previous pure
  map-reduce model, and provides better support for certain kinds of
  processing that were previously implemented using chains of
  map-reduce jobs.  This model also allows us to address various
  implementation issues and bugs in the previous map-reduce model.

  However, there is almost complete backward-compatible support for
  the previous map-reduce model, with little or no change required to
  existing Disco jobs; but see below for restrictions.

Changes
'''''''
The new pipeline model comes with several changes.

- The current :ref:`jobpack <jobpack>` format has changed slightly,
  reflected by an incremented version in the version field.  The main
  changes are in the fields of the ``jobdict``.  Jobpacks in the
  previous format are still supported; however, this support may be
  eventually removed in a future release.

- The :ref:`Disco worker protocol <worker_protocol>` has also changed
  to support the pipeline model, which is again reflected by an
  incremented version field in the :ref:`WORKER` message.  In
  particular, there are changes to the :ref:`TASK`, :ref:`INPUT` and
  :ref:`OUTPUT` protocol messages.  There is no support for the
  previous version of the protocol, hence implementations of the Disco
  worker protocol will need to be updated to the current protocol
  version to work with this release.  The standard Python and OCaml
  implementations support the new protocol.

- The shuffle stage of the default map-reduce pipeline is now done as
  an explicit pipeline stage.  When done after map, this results in a
  ``map_shuffle`` stage, whereas after reduce this becomes a
  ``reduce_shuffle`` stage.

  In previous versions of Disco, these shuffles were performed in
  implicit stages within the Disco master itself, and actually
  implemented in Erlang.  The shuffles now need to be performed in the
  Disco worker library code, and are implemented in both the Python
  and OCaml worker libraries.

- A ``save_results`` field in the ``jobdict`` of the jobpack is now
  interpreted by the Disco master.  Setting this to ``true`` tells the
  Disco master to save the job results into a DDFS tag.

  Previously, this functionality was implemented in the Disco worker
  library, and required the library to implement DDFS client
  interface.  Moving this to the master makes it easier to have this
  functionality in new language implementations of the Disco worker
  protocol and library.  For example, this is used in the OCaml Disco
  library.

- The web UI for jobs has changed slightly in order to show the stages
  of a job pipeline.

- Disco now uses lager 2.0 which can be integrated with syslog.

- Disco now works on FreeBSD 10.0.

- A continuous integration has been set up to compile the Erlang code,
  and make sure it passes the dialyzer and all of the unittests.

Backwards incompatible changes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
- See above discussion of the Disco worker protocol.

- Support for scheduler parameters in jobs (e.g. ``max_cores``,
  ``force_local``, and ``force_remote``) has been removed.  If present
  in a jobpack, they will be ignored.

- Support for the use of ``partitions`` in a Disco job is now limited.
  Previously, this was typically used to set the number of reduce
  tasks: when set to a number N, it was guaranteed that the job would
  have N reduce tasks.

  In this release, the number of reduce tasks is determined
  dynamically, using the user-generated labels attached to task
  outputs.  Hence, it is possible for a job with ``partitions`` set to
  N to have less than N reduce tasks (if, for e.g. there were fewer
  than N task output labels generated by the maps).  Since output
  labels in the default map-reduce pipeline are generated by the
  partition function, whether this discrepancy occurs depends on the
  partition function and the distribution of the inputs to it.

- Chaining the non-DDFS results of a job executed in a previous
  version (pre-0.5) of Disco into a job executed with this version
  (0.5) of Disco is not supported.

Bugfixes
''''''''
Please see the version control for the list of bug fixes.

Disco 0.4.5 (Mar 28, 2013)
--------------------------

Changes
'''''''

- Disco documentation is now also at `ReadTheDocs
  <http://disco.readthedocs.org>`_, along with documentation for
  `DiscoDB <http://discodb.readthedocs.org>`_.

- Mochiweb has been updated to fix compilation issues with Erlang 16B,
  which removed support for parameterized modules.

- Disco debian packages are no longer hosted on discoproject.org.
  Instead, Debian/Ubuntu users are encouraged to build their own
  packages for their particular Erlang/Python environment using the
  ``make-discoproject-debian`` script in the source tree.  Please read
  the comments in the script.

Bugfixes
''''''''

- Fix ``ddfs xcat`` display output, thanks to John Emhoff.

- Fix ``disco jobdict`` command (#341).

- Clarify the documentation in several places, thanks to feedback from
  Pavel Hančar, and fixes from John Emhoff.

- Fix a formatting bug in ``disco.util:urljoin``.

- Fixed job deletion from UI when job has quotes in name, thanks to
  @nvdev on Github.

- Ensure that *known* garbage in DDFS is deleted immediately, without
  waiting for the safety timeout required for blobs and tags of
  indeterminate status.

Disco 0.4.4 (Dec 5, 2012)
-------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

- The Python client library should now be Python3 compatible (version
  3.2 or higher).  As usual, the Python versions on the client and in
  the Disco cluster should match; mixed configurations are not
  supported.  Since Python3 differentiates between string and unicode
  objects, Disco jobs will need to do the same.  In particular, the
  default *map_reader* will provide ``bytes`` objects to the ``map``
  function.

- Client and master version commands have been added to the
  :mod:`disco <discocli>` command-line interface (issue #283).
  Currently, the client version command only works for Disco installed
  as a python egg.

- Installation support for NetBSD, thanks to Yamamoto Takashi.

- There is now a script to ease the creation of Disco debian packages,
  used to create the Debian packages provided from `discoproject.org
  <http://discoproject.org/doc/disco/start/download.html>`_.  Note
  that this script does *not* follow Debian packaging guidelines; use
  at your own risk!

- Small efficiency and logging improvements to DDFS.

Changes
'''''''

- The ``disco`` and ``ddfs`` command-line scripts are now packaged as
  part of python-disco Debian package, so that they can be used on
  clients.  Thanks to Daniel Graña.

Bugfixes
''''''''

- :func:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.pull` should now obey DISCO_PROXY settings.
  Thanks to Daniel Graña.

- Intercept Python warning messages to sys.stderr, which break the
  Disco worker protocol.  They are now logged as messages.  Thanks to
  Daniel Graña.

- The HTTP header handling in the Disco client library is more
  case-resilient.


Disco 0.4.3 (Aug 22, 2012)
--------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

- An extended Disco tutorial, thanks to Davin Potts.

- More documentation on using the proxy mode, and recovering from a
  master failure.

- More efficient (faster and using less memory) event_server, which
  should speed up UI responses for large jobs.

- Better fault-tolerance in re-replication, which should speed up
  node-removal.  Node-removal of more than one node is now better
  tested and supported.

- Less unnecessary creation of garbage tags in DDFS, by avoiding
  creating new tag incarnations when their content has not changed.
  Since less garbage is created, GC will now complete more quickly.

- A "local-cluster" mode for DDFS, that simulates a multi-node DDFS
  cluster on a single machine.  This is purely a developer feature for
  the purpose of improving DDFS testing, and cannot be used for
  running Disco jobs using DDFS.  Thanks to Harry Nakos.

Changes
'''''''

- Change the default partition function to use the key hash directly,
  instead of the string version of the key; this should address some
  unicode failures (#265).  Thanks to quasiben and tmielika.

- Improved logging, especially to track re-replication progress.

- Major cleanup of Erlang codebase.

Bugfixes
''''''''

- More fixes to DISCO_PROXY mode (#269).  This mode is required for
  using DDFS in the "local cluster" mode.

- Fix a race when the UI tried to access information for a job that
  had been submitted but not yet unpacked (#304).


Disco 0.4.2 (Apr 26, 2012)
--------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

- New fault-tolerant garbage collector and re-replicator (GC/RR).
- Allow scheduling of nodes for safe removal from DDFS (#201).
- Some useful GC statistics are now shown in the UI.

Changes
'''''''

- Discodb and Discodex separated out into submodule repositories.
- Master/Erlang build switched to rebar, with source tree re-organized
  appropriately.
- Master logging switched to lager.  Note that the format of the logs
  has changed as a result.
- Many dialyzer-related cleanups.  Thanks to Kostis Sagonas.
- Cleanup of debian package build.

Bugfixes
''''''''

- The new GC/RR closes #254, where a concurrent update to a tag was
  not handled at some points during GC.
- The new GC/RR also closes #256, where lost tag updates for
  re-replicated blobs caused later re-replication failures.
- Fix a case when the master node could run out of file descriptors
  when servicing an unexpectedly large number of jobpack requests from
  worker nodes (20d8fbe, 10a33b9, 0f7eaeb).
- Fixes to make DISCO_PROXY usable again (#269).  Thanks to Dmitrijs
  Milajevs.
- Fix a crash due to an already started lock server (64096a3).
- Handle an existing disco user on package install (4f04e14).  Thanks
  to Pedro Larroy.
- Fix a crash of ddfs_master due to timeouts in linked processes (#312).


Disco 0.4.1 (Sep 23rd 2011)
---------------------------

The official Disco repository is now at http://github.com/discoproject/disco

New features
''''''''''''

- DiscoDB: `ddb_cursor_count()` added. ``iterator.count()`` is now faster.
- DiscoDB: Value lists are now stored in deltalists instead of lists during
  discodb construction, resulting to 50-75% smaller memory footprint in the
  many-values-per-key case.

Bugfixes
''''''''

- Fix GC timeout issue (#268).
- Fix regression in Temp GC (09a1debb). Thanks to Jamie Brandon.
- Improved and fixed documentation. Thanks to Jens Rantil, stillinbeta and Luke Hoersten.
- Fix chunking. Thanks to Daniel Grana.
- Minor fixes in DiscoDB.
- Fix a bug in job pack extraction (e7b3b6).

Disco 0.4 (May 4th 2011)
------------------------

New features
''''''''''''
- :ref:`worker_protocol` introduced to support custom :term:`workers <worker>`,
  especially in languages besides Python
  (see `ODisco <https://github.com/pmundkur/odisco>`_
  for an OCaml worker now included in ``contrib``).
- Complete overhaul of the Python :mod:`disco.worker` to support the new protocol.
  Most notably the worker is now completely self-contained - you do not have to
  install Python libraries on slave nodes anymore.
- :ref:`jobhistory` makes using the command-line less tedious.
  Several other enhancements to :mod:`disco <discocli>` and :mod:`ddfs <ddfscli>`
  command line tools.
- :ref:`setup` is easier than ever.
  Updated Debian packaging and dependencies make :ref:`install_sys` a breeze.
- More documentation, including a :ref:`discodb_tutorial`
  using extended :class:`disco.job.Job` classes.
- Throttling of messages coming from the worker,
  to prevent them from overwhelming the master without killing the process.
- Upgraded to `mochiweb <https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb>`_ 2.0.
- Support for log rotation on the :term:`master` via :envvar:`DISCO_ROTATE_LOG`.
- *prefix* is now optional for jobs.
- Many Dialyzer-related improvements.
- Separate Debian branch containing rules to create Debian packages merged under ``pkg``.
- Debian package for DiscoDB.
- :ref:`discoext` provides the task type on the command line, to allow a single
  binary to handle both map and reduce phases.

Bugfixes
''''''''
- DDFS:
    - **important** Recreating a previously deleted tag with a
      token did not work correctly. The call returned without an error but the tag
      was not created.
    - Under some circumstances DDFS garbage collector deleted .partial files,
      causing PUT operations to fail (6deef33f).
- Redundant inputs using the ``http://`` scheme were not handled correctly (``disco://`` scheme worked ok) (9fcc740d).
- Fix `eaddrinuse` errors caused by already running nodes (1eed58d08).
- Fix newlines in error messages in the web UI.
- The web UI no longer loses the filter when the events are refreshed.
- Several fixes in `node_mon`. It should handle unavailable nodes now more robustly.
- The OOB issue (#227) highlighted below became a non-issue as GC takes care of removing OOB results when the job is garbage collected.
- Fix the issue with the job starting even when the client got an error when submitting a new job.


Deprecated
''''''''''
- :func:`disco.util.data_err`, :func:`disco.util.err`, and :func:`disco.util.msg`,
  have all been deprecated in favor of using ``raise`` and ``print`` statements.
- Jobs without inputs i.e. generator maps: See the `raw://` protocol in :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job`.
- *map_init* and *reduce_init* deprecated. Use *input_stream* or *reader* instead.
- *scheme_dfs* removed.
- Deprecated ``DDFS_ROOT`` setting, use ``DDFS_DATA`` instead.

Disco 0.3.2 (Dec 6th 2010)
--------------------------

.. note::
   In contrast to earlier releases, in ``0.3.2`` purging a job does not delete
   OOB results of the job automatically. This is listed as issue #227 and will
   be fixed in the next release together with other changes in OOB handling.
   Meanwhile, you can use :meth:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.delete` to delete OOB
   results if needed.

New features
''''''''''''
 - Built-in support for chunking large inputs (see :ref:`tutorial` and :meth:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.chunk`).
 - List of blacklisted nodes is persistent over restarts.
 - Disconnected nodes are now highlighted in the web UI.
 - Explicit hostname (``tag://host/tag``) is now allowed in tag urls.
 - Some commonly used functions added to :mod:`disco.func`:
    - :func:`disco.func.gzip_line_reader`
    - :func:`disco.func.sum_combiner`
    - :func:`disco.func.sum_reduce`
 - Job owner shown in the web UI (can be overridden with the ``DISCO_JOB_OWNER`` setting).
 - ``DISCO_WORKER_MAX_MEM`` setting can be used to limit the maximum amount of memory that can be used by a worker process.
 - :ref:`ddfs`:
    - Tags can now contain arbitrary user-defined attributes (see :ref:`ddfsapi` and :meth:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.setattr` and :meth:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.getattr`).
    - Basic token-based permission control for tags (see :ref:`ddfsapi`).
    - Improved REST API (see :ref:`ddfsapi`).
    - ``DDFS_PARANOID_DELETE`` setting allows an external program to be used to delete or verify obsolete files (see :mod:`disco.settings`).
 - Functions are now allowed in arguments of `partial job functions <http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html#functools.partial>`_.
 - Improved documentation, and a new document :ref:`administer`.

Bugfixes
''''''''

 - Tasks may be marked successful before results are persisted to disk (#208).
 - Improved error handling for badly dying tasks (#162).
 - Allow dots in DDFS paths (#196).
 - Improved handling of out of memory conditions (#168, #200).

 - Fixed error handling if sort fails.
 - Tutorial example fixed.
 - HTTP error message made more informative.

Disco 0.3.1 (Sep 1st 2010)
--------------------------

.. note::
   This release fixes a serious bug in how partition files are handled under
   certain error conditions. The bug has existed since Disco 0.1.

   If a node becomes unavailable, for instance due to network congestion, master restarts
   the tasks that were running on the failed node on other nodes. However, it is possible
   that old tasks continue running on the failed node, producing results as usual.
   This can lead to duplicate entries being written to result files.

   Note that not all task failures are suspectible to this bug. If the task
   itself fails, which is the most typical error scenario, Disco ensures that results are
   still valid. Only if your job events have contained messages like ``Node unavailable``
   or ``Connection lost to the node``, it is possible that results are invalid and you
   should re-run the suspected jobs with Disco 0.3.1 or newer.

   This bug also revealed a similar issue with jobs that save their results to
   DDFS with ``save=True`` (available since Disco 0.3). It is possible that
   duplicate tasks create duplicate entries in the result tag. This is easy to
   detect and fix afterwards by listing urls in the tag and ensuring that there
   are no duplicates. A script is provided at ``util/fix-jobtag`` that can be
   used to check and fix suspected tags.


New features
''''''''''''

 - Improved robustness and scalability:
    - Jobs are now immortal by default; they should never fail due to temporary errors unless a user-defined limit is reached.
    - New shuffle phase to optimize intermediate results for reduce.
    - Support for `Varnish <http://varnish-cache.org/>`_ for ``DISCO_PROXY``. In some cases, Varnish can be over three times faster than `Lighttpd <http://lighttpd.net/>`_.
 - :ref:`ddfs`:
    - Improved blob placement policy.
    - Atomic set updates (``update=1``).
    - Delayed commits (``delayed=1``), which gives a major performance boost without sacrificing data consistency.
    - Garbage collection is now scheme-agnostic (#189).
 - Major DiscoDB enhancements:
    - Values are now compressed without sacrificing performance.
    - Constructor accepts unsorted key-value pairs.
    - Option (``unique_items=True``) to remove duplicates from inputs automatically.
    - ``unique_values()`` iterator.
 - Alternative signature for reduce: Reduce can now ``yield`` key-value pairs (or return an iterator) instead of calling ``out.add()`` (see :func:`disco.func.reduce2`).
 - Enhanced Java support added as a Git submodule under ``contrib/java-ext``
   (`Thanks to Ryan Maus <http://github.com/ryan-maus/disco-java-ext>`_).
 - Disk space monitoring for DDFS added to the Web UI.
 - Lots of enhancements to :mod:`disco <discocli>` command line.
 - New setting ``DISCO_SORT_BUFFER_SIZE`` to control memory usage of the external sort (see :mod:`disco.settings`).
 - :func:`disco.func.gzip_reader` for reading gzipped inputs.
 - Easier single-node installation with default localhost configuration.

Deprecated
''''''''''

 - **Important!** The default reader function, :func:`disco.func.map_line_reader`, will be deprecated. The new default
   is to iterate over the object returned by *map_reader*. In practice, the default
   *map_reader* will still return an object that iterates over lines. However,
   it will not strip newline characters from the end of lines as the old :func:`disco.func.map_line_reader` does.

   Make sure that your jobs that rely on the default *map_reader* will
   handle newline characters correctly. You can do this easily by calling
   ``string.strip()`` for each line.

Backwards incompatible changes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

 - Installation script for Amazon EC2 removed (``aws/setup-instances.py``) and documentation updated accordingly (see :ref:`ec2`). Disco still works in Amazon EC2 and other similar environments flawlessly but a more modern mechanism for easy deployments is needed.

Disco 0.2.4 (February 8th 2010)
-------------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

 - New fair job scheduler which replaces the old FIFO queue. The scheduler is
   inspired by `Hadoop's Fair Scheduler <http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.20.1/fair_scheduler.html>`_.
   Running multiple jobs in parallel is now supported properly.
 - *Scheduler* option to control data locality and resource usage. See :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job`.

Disco 0.2.3 (September 9th 2009)
--------------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

 - The :mod:`disco.settings` control script makes setting up and running Disco much easier than
   before.
 - Console output of job events (`screenshot
   <_static/screenshots/disco-events.png>`_). You can now follow progress of a job
   on the console instead of the web UI by setting ``DISCO_EVENTS=1``.
   See :meth:`disco.core.Disco.events` and :meth:`disco.core.Disco.wait`.
 - Automatic inference and distribution of dependent modules. See :mod:`disco.modutil`.
 - *required_files* parameter added to :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job`.
 - Combining the previous two features, a new easier way to use external C
   libraries is provided, see :ref:`discoext`.
 - Support for Python 2.6 and 2.7.
 - Easier installation of a simple single-server cluster. Just run ``disco
   master start`` on the disco directory. The ``DISCO_MASTER_PORT`` setting is deprecated.
 - Improved support for OS X. The ``DISCO_SLAVE_OS`` setting is deprecated.
 - Debian packages upgraded to use Erlang 13B.
 - Several improvements related to fault-tolerance of the system
 - Serialize job parameters using more efficient and compact binary format.
 - Improved support for GlusterFS (2.0.6 and newer).
 - Support for the pre-0.1 ``disco`` module, ``disco.job`` call etc., removed.

Bugfixes
''''''''

 - **critical** External sort didn't work correctly with non-numeric keys (5ef88ad4)

   again (e5c20bbfec4)
 - Filter fixed on the web UI (bug #4, e9c265b)
 - Tracebacks are now shown correctly on the web UI (bug #3, ea26802ce)
 - Fixed negative number of maps on the web UI (bug #28, 5b23327 and 3e079b7)
 - The ``comm_curl`` module might return an insufficient number of bytes (761c28c4a)
 - Temporary node failure (noconnection) shouldn't be a fatal error (bug #22, ad95935)
 - *nr_maps* and *nr_reduces* limits were off by one (873d90a7)
 - Fixed a Javascript bug on the config table (11bb933)
 - Timeouts in starting a new worker shouldn't be fatal (f8dfcb94)
 - The connection pool in ``comm_httplib`` didn't work correctly (bug #30, 5c9d7a88e9)
 - Added timeouts to ``comm_curl`` to fix occasional issues with the connection
   getting stuck (2f79c698)
 - All `IOErrors` and `CommExceptions` are now non-fatal (f1d4a127c)


Disco 0.2.2 (July 26th 2009)
----------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

 - Experimental support for POSIX-compatible distributed filesystems,
   in particular `GlusterFS <http://gluster.com>`_. Two modes are available: Disco
   can read input data from a distributed filesystem while preserving data locality
   (aka *inputfs*). Disco can also use a DFS for internal communication,
   replacing the need for node-specific web servers (aka *resultfs*).


Bugfixes
''''''''

 - ``DISCO_PROXY`` handles now out-of-band results correctly (commit b1c0f9911)
 - `make-lighttpd-proxyconf.py` now ignores commented out lines in `/etc/hosts` (bug #14, commit a1a93045d)
 - Fixed missing PID file in the `disco-master` script. The `/etc/init.d/disco-master` script in Debian packages now works correctly (commit 223c2eb01)
 - Fixed a regression in `Makefile`. Config files were not copied to `/etc/disco` (bug #13, commit c058e5d6)
 - Increased `server.max-write-idle` setting in Lighttpd config. This prevents the http connection from disconnecting with long running, cpu-intensive reduce tasks  (bug #12, commit 956617b0)


Disco 0.2.1 (May 26th 2009)
---------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

 - Support for redundant inputs: You can now specify many redundant addresses for an input file. Scheduler chooses the address which points at the node with the lowest load. If the address fails, other addresses are tried one by one until the task succeeds. See *inputs* in :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job` for more information.
 - Task profiling: See :ref:`profiling`
 - Implemented an efficient way to poll for results of many concurrent jobs. See :meth:`disco.core.Disco.results`.
 - Support for the `Curl <http://curl.haxx.se>`_ HTTP client library added. Curl is used by default if the ``pycurl`` module is available.
 - Improved storing of intermediate results: Results are now spread to a directory hierarchy based on the md5 checkum of the job name.

Bugfixes
''''''''

 - Check for ``ionice`` before using it. (commit dacbbbf785)
 - ``required_modules`` didn't handle submodules (PIL.Image etc.) correctly (commit a5b9fcd970)
 - Missing file balls.png added. (bug #7, commit d5617a788)
 - Missing and crashed nodes don't cause the job to fail (bug #2, commit 6a5e7f754b)
 - Default value for nr_reduces now never exceeds 100 (bug #9, commit 5b9e6924)
 - Fixed homedisco regression in 0.2. (bugs #5, #10, commit caf78f77356)

Disco 0.2 (April 7th 2009)
--------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

 - :ref:`oob`: A mechanism to produce auxiliary results in map/reduce tasks.
 - Map writers, reduce readers and writers (see :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job`): Support for custom result formats and internal protocols.
 - Support for arbitrary output types.
 - Custom task initialization functions: See *map_init* and *reduce_init* in :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job`.
 - Jobs without inputs i.e. generator maps: See the `raw://` protocol in :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job`.
 - Reduces without maps for efficient join and merge operations: See :ref:`reduceonly`.

Bugfixes
''''''''

(NB: bug IDs in 0.2 refer to the old bug tracking system)

 - ``chunked = false`` mode produced incorrect input files for the reduce phase (commit db718eb6)
 - Shell enabled for the disco master process (bug #7, commit 7944e4c8)
 - Added warning about unknown parameters in ``new_job()`` (bug #8, commit db707e7d)
 - Fix for sending invalid configuration data (bug #1, commit bea70dd4)
