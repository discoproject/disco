Release notes
=============

Disco 0.3.2 (Dec 6th 2010)
--------------------------

.. note::
   In contrast to earlier releases, in ``0.3.2`` purging a job does not delete
   OOB results of the job automatically. This is listed as issue #227 and will
   be fixed in the next release together with other changes in OOB handling.
   Meanwhile, you can use :meth:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.delete` to delete OOB
   results if needed.

New features
''''''''''''
 - Built-in support for chunking large inputs (see :ref:`tutorial` and :meth:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.chunk`).
 - List of blacklisted nodes is persistent over restarts.
 - Disconnected nodes are now highlighted in the web UI.
 - Explicit hostname (``tag://host/tag``) is now allowed in tag urls.
 - Some commonly used functions added to :mod:`disco.func`:
    - :func:`disco.func.gzip_line_reader`
    - :func:`disco.func.sum_combiner`
    - :func:`disco.func.sum_reduce`
 - Job owner shown in the web UI (can be overridden with the ``DISCO_JOB_OWNER`` setting).
 - ``DISCO_WORKER_MAX_MEM`` setting can be used to limit the maximum amount of memory that can be used by a worker process.
 - :ref:`ddfs`:
    - Tags can now contain arbitrary user-defined attributes (see :ref:`ddfsapi` and :meth:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.setattr` and :meth:`disco.ddfs.DDFS.getattr`).
    - Basic token-based permission control for tags (see :ref:`ddfsapi`).
    - Improved REST API (see :ref:`ddfsapi`).
    - ``DDFS_PARANOID_DELETE`` setting allows an external program to be used to delete or verify obsolete files (see :mod:`disco.settings`).
 - Functions are now allowed in arguments of `partial job functions <http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html#functools.partial>`_.
 - Improvements in :mod:`discodb` and :ref:`discodex`.
 - Improved documentation, and a new document :ref:`administer`.

Disco 0.3.1 (Sep 1st 2010)
--------------------------

.. note::
   This release fixes a serious bug in how partition files are handled under
   certain error conditions. The bug has existed since Disco 0.1.

   If a node becomes unavailable, for instance due to network congestion, master restarts
   the tasks that were running on the failed node on other nodes. However, it is possible
   that old tasks continue running on the failed node, producing results as usual.
   This can lead to duplicate entries being written to result files.

   Note that not all task failures are suspectible to this bug. If the task
   itself fails, which is the most typical error scenario, Disco ensures that results are
   still valid. Only if your job events have contained messages like ``Node unavailable``
   or ``Connection lost to the node``, it is possible that results are invalid and you
   should re-run the suspected jobs with Disco 0.3.1 or newer.

   This bug also revealed a similar issue with jobs that save their results to
   DDFS with ``save=True`` (available since Disco 0.3). It is possible that
   duplicate tasks create duplicate entries in the result tag. This is easy to
   detect and fix afterwards by listing urls in the tag and ensuring that there
   are no duplicates. A script is provided at ``util/fix-jobtag`` that can be
   used to check and fix suspected tags.


New features
''''''''''''

 - Improved robustness and scalability:
    - Jobs are now immortal by default; they should never fail due to temporary errors unless a user-defined limit is reached.
    - New shuffle phase to optimize intermediate results for reduce.
    - Support for `Varnish <http://varnish-cache.org/>`_ for ``DISCO_PROXY``. In some cases, Varnish can be over three times faster than `Lighttpd <http://lighttpd.net/>`_.
 - :ref:`ddfs`:
    - Improved blob placement policy.
    - Atomic set updates (``update=1``).
    - Delayed commits (``delayed=1``), which gives a major performance boost without sacrificing data consistency.
    - Garbage collection is now scheme-agnostic (#189).
 - Major :mod:`discodb` enhancements:
    - Values are now compressed without sacrificing performance.
    - Constructor accepts unsorted key-value pairs.
    - Option (``unique_items=True``) to remove duplicates from inputs automatically.
    - ``unique_values()`` iterator.
 - Alternative signature for reduce: Reduce can now ``yield`` key-value pairs (or return an iterator) instead of calling ``out.add()`` (see :func:`disco.func.reduce2`).
 - Enhanced Java support added as a Git submodule under ``contrib/java-ext``
   (`Thanks to Ryan Maus <http://github.com/ryan-maus/disco-java-ext>`_).
 - Disk space monitoring for DDFS added to the Web UI.
 - Lots of enhancements to :mod:`discodex <discodexcli>` and :mod:`disco <discocli>` command line utilities.
 - New setting ``DISCO_SORT_BUFFER_SIZE`` to control memory usage of the external sort (see :mod:`disco.settings`).
 - :func:`disco.func.gzip_reader` for reading gzipped inputs.
 - Easier single-node installation with default localhost configuration.

Deprecated
''''''''''

 - **Important!** The default reader function, :func:`disco.func.map_line_reader`, will be deprecated. The new default
   is to iterate over the object returned by *map_reader*. In practice, the default
   *map_reader* will still return an object that iterates over lines. However,
   it will not strip newline characters from the end of lines as the old :func:`disco.func.map_line_reader` does.

   Make sure that your jobs that rely on the default *map_reader* will
   handle newline characters correctly. You can do this easily by calling
   ``string.strip()`` for each line.

Backwards incompatible changes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

 - Installation script for Amazon EC2 removed (``aws/setup-instances.py``) and documentation updated accordingly (see :ref:`ec2`). Disco still works in Amazon EC2 and other similar environments flawlessly but a more modern mechanism for easy deployments is needed.

   anymore, making it possible to run Disco locally from Debian packages.

Deprecated 
''''''''''

Disco 0.2.2 (July 26th 2009)
----------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

 - Experimental support for POSIX-compatible distributed filesystems, 
   in particular `GlusterFS <http://gluster.com>`_. Two modes are available: Disco
   can read input data from a distributed filesystem while preserving data locality
   (aka *inputfs*). Disco can also use a DFS for internal communication,
   replacing the need for node-specific web servers (aka *resultfs*).


Bugfixes
''''''''

 - ``DISCO_PROXY`` handles now out-of-band results correctly (commit b1c0f9911)
 - `make-lighttpd-proxyconf.py` now ignores commented out lines in `/etc/hosts` (bug #14, commit a1a93045d) 
 - Fixed missing PID file in the `disco-master` script. The `/etc/init.d/disco-master` script in Debian packages now works correctly (commit 223c2eb01)
 - Fixed a regression in `Makefile`. Config files were not copied to `/etc/disco` (bug #13, commit c058e5d6)
 - Increased `server.max-write-idle` setting in Lighttpd config. This prevents the http connection from disconnecting with long running, cpu-intensive reduce tasks  (bug #12, commit 956617b0)


Disco 0.2.1 (May 26th 2009)
---------------------------

New features
''''''''''''

 - Support for redundant inputs: You can now specify many redundant addresses for an input file. Scheduler chooses the address which points at the node with the lowest load. If the address fails, other addresses are tried one by one until the task succeeds. See *inputs* in :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job` for more information.
 - Task profiling: See :ref:`profiling`
 - Implemented an efficient way to poll for results of many concurrent jobs. See :meth:`disco.core.Disco.results`.
 - Support for the `Curl <http://curl.haxx.se>`_ HTTP client library added. Curl is used by default if the ``pycurl`` module is available.
 - Improved storing of intermediate results: Results are now spread to a directory hierarchy based on the md5 checkum of the job name.

Bugfixes
''''''''

 - Check for ``ionice`` before using it. (commit dacbbbf785)
 - ``required_modules`` didn't handle submodules (PIL.Image etc.) correctly (commit a5b9fcd970)
