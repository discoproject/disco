Using Disco
-----------

I tried to install Disco but it doesn't work. Why? 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

See :ref:`troubleshooting`. If the problem persist, contact
Disco developers `either on IRC or on the mailing list
<http://discoproject.org/getinvolved.html>`_.

Why not `Hadoop <http://hadoop.apache.org>`_?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Why `Vim <http://www.vim.org>`_ and not `Emacs
<http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_?

We see that platforms for distributed computing will be of such high
importance in the future that it is crucial to have a wide variety of
different approaches which produces healthy competition and co-evolution
between the projects. In this respect, Hadoop and Disco can be seen as
complementary projects, similar to `Apache <http://httpd.apache.org>`_,
`Lighttpd <http://lighttpd.net>`_ and `Nginx <http://nginx.net>`_.

It is a matter of taste whether Erlang and Python are more suitable for
the task than Java. We feel much more productive with Python than with
Java. We also feel that Erlang is a perfect match for the Disco core
that needs to handle tens of thousands of tasks in parallel.

Thanks to Erlang, the Disco core remarkably compact, currently less
than 2000 lines of code. It is relatively easy to understand how
the core works, and start experimenting with it or adapt it to new
environments. Thanks to Python, it is easy to add new features around
the core which ensures that Disco can respond quickly to real-world needs.

.. _profiling:

How to profile programs in Disco?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
*New in Disco 0.2.1*

Disco can use the Python's standard `Profile module
<http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html>`_ to profile map and reduce
tasks. Enable profiling by setting ``profile = True`` in :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job`.
Once the job has finished, you can retrieve the results of profiling with the 
:meth:`disco.core.Disco.profile_stats` function. 

Here's a simple example::

        from disco.core import Disco, Params

        def fun_map(e, params):
                return [(e, 1)]

        job = Disco("disco://localhost").new_job(
                      name = "params_test",
                      input = ["disco://localhost/myjob/file1"],
                      map = fun_map,
                      profile = True)
        results = job.wait()

        # retrieve results of profiling
        stats = job.profile_stats()
        # sort results by descending cumulative time
        stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
        # print out results
        stats.print_stats()

How to debug programs in Disco?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Set up a single node Disco cluster locally on your laptop or desktop. It makes
debugging a Disco job almost as easy as debugging any Python script.

.. _outputtypes:

How can I output arbitrary Python objects in map and reduce, not only strings?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
*New in Disco 0.2*

To pass arbitrary Python objects between map and reduce, 
set *map_writer* to
:func:`disco.func.object_writer` and *reduce_reader* to
:func:`disco.func.object_reader` in :meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job`. 

If you want to output arbitrary objects in your reduce function, set also 
*reduce_writer* to :func:`disco.func.object_writer`. If you want to use
:func:`disco.core.result_iterator` to read results, set its *reader* parameter
to :func:`disco.func.object_reader`.

.. _reduceonly:

Do I always have to provide a function for map and reduce?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
*Updated for Disco 0.2 which supports the reduce-only case*

You have to specify either map or reduce or both. Many simple tasks can be
solved with a single map function, without reduce. 

It is somewhat less typical to specify only the reduce function. This case 
mainly arises when you want to merge results from many independent map jobs, 
or you want to join several input files without going through the map phase.

You can of course run many independent reduce-jobs
for different sets of input files, if your input files belong to different
"partitions". In this case you probably want to set *reduce_reader* in
:meth:`disco.core.Disco.new_job` to match with the format of your input files.

How many maps can I have? Does higher number of maps lead to better performance?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In theory there is no restriction. In practice, the number is of course
limited by the available disk space (for input files) and the amount of
RAM that is required by the Disco master. Disco includes a test case,
in ``test/test50k.py`` that starts 50,000 map tasks in parallel. You
should be able to add a few zeroes there without any trouble. If you
perform any stress tests of your own, let us know about your findings!

Each map and reduce instance is allocated exclusive access to a CPU. This
means that the number of parallel processes is limited by the number of
available CPUs. If you have 50,000 map instances but only 50 CPUs, only
50 maps are run in parallel while 49,550 instances are either waiting
in the job queue or marked as ready --- assuming that no other jobs are
running in the system at the same time and your input is split to at
least 50,000 separate files.

The number of maps can never exceed the number of input files as Disco
can't order many maps to process a single input file. In other words,
to run *K* maps in parallel you need at least *K* input files.

In general, the question about the expected speedup when increasing
parallelism is a rather complicated one and it depends heavily on the task
at hand. See `Amdahl's Law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_Law>`_
for more information about the subject. However, unless your tasks are
so light that the execution time is dominated by the overhead caused
by Disco, you can expect to gain some speedup by adding more maps until
the number of maps equals to the number of available CPUs.

How do I pass the output of one map-reduce phase to another?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Many algorithms can be implemented cleanly as a sequence of consequent
map-reduce jobs. Chaining jobs together is also efficient, as the job's
results are readily distributed and stored in the Disco's internal format.

Here's an example that runs ten jobs in a sequence, using outputs from
the previous job as the input for the next one. The job increments each
value in the input by one::

        from disco.core import Disco, result_iterator
        from disco.func import chain_reader
        import sys

        def init_map(line, params):
                return [(int(line) + 1, "")]

        def iter_map(e, params):
                key, value = e
                return [(int(key) + 1, "")]
        
        disco = Disco("disco://localhost")
        results = disco.new_job(name = "inc_init",
                               input = sys.argv[2:],
                               map = init_map).wait()

        for i in range(9):
                results = disco.new_job(name =  "inc_%d" % i, 
                                        input = results,
                                        map = iter_map,
                                        map_reader = chain_reader).wait()

        for key, value in result_iterator(results):
                print key

Assuming that the input files consists of zeroes, this example will
produce a sequence of tens as the result.

Note the following things in the example: You probably need two
separate map functions, like *init_map* and *iter_map* above. The
former handles the initial input from the original input files and the
latter map handles input from the previous map function. When using
:func:`disco.func.chain_reader` as the map reader, which reads results
of a previous job as the input, the input entry for the map function
is naturally a key-value pair whereas in the default case it is a line
of text.

Note that the job name includes a counter variable. This ensures that
each job name is unique, as required by Disco.


How to maintain state across many map / reduce calls?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Use the parameters object :class:`disco.core.Params` as the closure for
your functions. Here's an example::

        from disco.core import Disco, Params

        def fun_map(e, params):
                params.c += 1
                if not params.c % 10:
                        return [(e, "good")]
                else:
                        return [(e, "not good")]

        Disco("disco://localhost").new_job(
                      name = "params_test",
                      input = ["disco://localhost/myjob/file1"],
                      map = fun_map,
                      params = Params(c = 0))

In this case *params.c* is a counter variable that is incremented in
every call to the map function.

How to send log entries from my functions to the Web interface?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Use the :func:`disco_worker.msg` function. Here's an example::

        from disco.core import Disco, Params

        def fun_map(e, params):
                params.c += 1
                if not c % 100000:
                        msg("Now processing %dth entry" % params.c)
                return [(e, 1)]

        Disco("disco://localhost").new_job(
                  name = "log_test",
                  input = ["disco://localhost/myjob/file1"],
                  map = fun_map,
                  params = Params(c = 0))

Note that you must not call :func:`disco_worker.msg` too often. If you send more
than 10 messages per second, Disco will kill your job.


My input files are stored in CSV / XML / XYZ format. What is the easiest to use them in Disco?
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If the format is textual, it may be possible to define a regular
expression that can be used to extract input entries from the files. See
:func:`disco.func.re_reader` for more information.
