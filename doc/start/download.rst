Get Disco
=========

The Disco source code is available at `github`_.  To get the latest
development branch::

        git clone git://github.com/discoproject/disco.git

For released versions, check out the appropriate release tag from the
repository.

If compiling from source, you cannot use the zip or tar.gz packages
generated by github, but must instead get the git repo using the above
command.
