Tutorial
========

This tutorial will walk you through the steps necessary to get Discodex
up and running on your local machine.
It will also walk you through the basic concepts of building and querying
indices with Discodex.
To install Discodex on a server or using a remote Disco master, you should
only need to change a few :mod:`discodex.settings`.

Installation
''''''''''''

Install Django
--------------

Discodex uses the Python web framework, `Django`_,
to handle requests coming to the HTTP server and map them to Disco Jobs.
The Django server acts as a Disco client for you,
so that you can use Discodex from thin clients, such as web applications.

Follow the instructions `here <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/intro/install/#install-django>`_.
You must also have `lighttpd <http://www.lighttpd.net/download/>`_ installed,
as well as `flup <http://trac.saddi.com/flup>`_.

If you want to understand why these other projects are used,
read `this <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/fastcgi/>`_.

Install Discodex
----------------

To run Discodex, the Python package and :program:`discodex` command line utility must be installed.
See :mod:`discodex <discodexcli>` for information on installing the command line utility.
You can install the Python package either using a symlink, or by running::

        make install-discodex

Using Discodex
''''''''''''''

Start Disco
-----------

If you haven't already started a Disco master, you will need to do so now.
Discodex requires that a Disco master be running at :envvar:`DISCODEX_DISCO_MASTER`,
so that it can submit jobs to it.

Usually, you can start Disco simply by running::

        disco start

For more information on starting Disco, see :ref:`setup`.

Start Discodex
--------------

Discodex runs its own HTTP server which translates HTTP requests into
Disco jobs.
In order to use Discodex, you will need to start the server::

         discodex start

Build an Index
--------------

Discodex makes it easy to build indices from data, assuming you know how you
want to create keys and values from your data.
The default :mod:`parser <discodex.mapreduce.parsers>` for Discodex,
is ``rawparse``.
It simply takes the string attached to ``raw://`` URLs, and decodes them in
a special way to produce keys and values::

        echo raw://hello:world | discodex index

If you check the disco status web page, you can still see the job Discodex
executed to build the index.
If you see the 'green light' next to the job, you've successfully built
your first index!
The job will remain there until you read it for the first time.
Officially, it won't become an index until you read it using
:command:`discodex get` or some other command (such as :command:`discodex clone`).
You can confirm that you don't see it yet when you do::

        discodex list

Using the name of the job returned from the :command:`discodex index` command,
let's go ahead and make it official::

        discodex get <INDEX>

You should see the `tag` object stored on DDFS printed out.
You should also see the index name now when you do::

        discodex list

Let's copy the index to a more human-readable name::

        discodex clone <INDEX> toyindex

Once more, let's see whats available::

        discodex list

Notice the prefix.
This is the prefix stored in the settings :envvar:`DISCODEX_INDEX_PREFIX`.
Generally speaking, you can ignore this prefix and just use the name you gave it.
The reason it exists is to provide Discodex with its own namespace in :ref:`ddfs`, where the indices are stored.

Let's try seeing the keys stored in the index::

        discodex keys toyindex

And the values::

        discodex values toyindex

Let's also try querying it::

        discodex query toyindex hello

If you have :mod:`ddfs <ddfscli>` installed, you can try::

        ddfs ls
        ddfs ls discodex

Notice how the indices are just tags stored on DDFS.

Now that we've created our first index and queried it, let's clean up our mess::

        discodex list | xargs -n 1 discodex delete

You could have also done::

        ddfs ls discodex: | xargs ddfs rm

.. warning:: Be careful, these commands will delete all your indices!

If you ran the queries against Discodex,
you should still see the query jobs Discodex ran on the Disco web interface.
If you want Discodex to cleanup after itself automatically,
:command:`touch` the file stored in the :envvar:`DISCODEX_PURGE_FILE` setting.
If you don't know what file that is, just run::

        discodex -v

If the purge file exists, Discodex will purge query jobs after they complete.
If you ever need to know why a query job fails,
its a good idea to turn off purging.
If you have :mod:`disco <discocli>` installed,
you can clean up any remaining jobs using::

        disco jobs | xargs disco purge

.. warning:: Be careful, this command will purge all of your Disco jobs!

Querying the index
------------------

Let's build a slightly more complicated index and try querying it::

        echo raw://hello:world,hello:there,hi:world,hi:mom | discodex index
        discodex clone <index> rawindex

Go ahead and try the following queries::

        discodex query rawindex hello
        discodex query rawindex hi
        discodex query rawindex hello hi
        discodex query rawindex hello,hi

Discodex queries the underlying :mod:`discodb` objects using
:term:`conjunctive normal form`.
In queries from the command line, you can use spaces to separate clauses,
and commas to separate literals.

Index the docs
--------------

Let's try indexing some real files now.
We can use the Disco documentation::

        find $DISCO_HOME/doc -name \*.rst | discodex index --parser wordparse

.. note:: Any text files will work, just make sure to pass absolute paths.

Let's name the index::

        discodex clone <INDEX> words

If you indexed the docs as above,
you can now see which files contain the word ``discodex``::

        discodex query words discodex

We can also see which files contain the words ``discodex`` *and* ``build``::

        discodex query words discodex build

Congratulations, you've built a basic search engine!

Build a Metaindex
-----------------

A :term:`metaindex` is an index built on top of the keys of another index.
The easiest way to understand what it does is probably just to build one.
As an example, let's build a metaindex of our ``words`` index to
make our documentation search engine slightly more robust::

        discodex metaindex --metakeyer prefixkeyer words
        discodex clone <METAINDEX> metawords

Using the ``prefixkeyer``, we mapped all possible prefixes of all of the keys
in our index to the keys themselves, and stored them in the metaindex,
along with the original index.
Convince yourself that all the prefixes are actually there::

        discodex keys metawords | sort | less

Now if we query our metaindex,
we can see not only the files which contain the exact words we are querying,
but any files which contain words *starting* with our query words::

        discodex query metawords discodex

First, notice how the metaindex returns both the original keys from your index,
and an iterator over the values of each of those keys.
Also notice what happens when you execute more complicated queries::

        discodex query metawords discodex build

You shouldn't see any results.
This is because the query first gets executed on the :class:`discodb.MetaDB`,
and there aren't any words that begin with both ``discodex`` *and* ``build``.
Finally, let's see which documents contain words starting with *either*
``discodex`` *or* ``build``::

        discodex query metawords discodex,build

Hopefully at this point, you can imagine writing
:mod:`discodex.mapreduce.metakeyers`, that allow you to query your data in
all kinds of interesting ways.

Remember, Discodex scales automatically with the size of your cluster,
so don't be afraid to try it out with millions or billions of keys and values!
